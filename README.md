# SADS (Skyward Active Directory Sync)

Note: this projcect was previously under the name of "SkywardStudentImport". It was changed to SADS on Sept 22nd 2021.

Using the output of Skyward's Skybuilds Exports builder, take the user data and create/enable/disable users in 
Active Directory.

For now, much of the script's documentation is inside the script itself as comments. But I am also trying to update the documentation here and in the Wiki page of this repositroy.

tl;dr:
1. Skyward exports to your user data using SFTP/FTPS.
2. This script runs against your generated file and creates/enables/disables the users.

More details comming in the future...
