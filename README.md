# SkywardStudentImport
Using the output of Skyward's Skybuilds Exports builder, take the students data and create/enable/disable users in 
Active Directory.

tl;dr:
1. Skyward exports to your student data using SFTP/FTPS.
2. This script runs against your generated file and creates/enables/disables the users.

More detailed documentation comming soon...
